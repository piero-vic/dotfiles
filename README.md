# `.dotfiles`

These are my dotfiles, a collection of my configuration files for macOS.

## Tools I use
- [wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) as my terminal emulator.
- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for editing text.
- [starship](https://starship.rs/) for the prompt.
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) for the shell.
